For this assignment, you will be redesigning the website for one of Washington University's departments or schools. You can find the list of schools about half way down the page and on the left of this page: https://wustl.edu/academics/﻿.


﻿Your goal is to improve the usability, content, and design of the site to make the school more attractive to potential students, and more useful for current students. You will need to accomplish the following:


* Consider the audience your site is trying to reach, and make sure you engage the audience. This is accomplished by clearly indicating who the site is for, and directing users to the information or actions they may be looking for.
* Consider the actions you want users to take while browsing your site, and make them easily accessible. This is accomplished by creating "call to action" links on your page that are easy to find.
* Consider the information that you want users to return to your site in the future to find, such as news and announcements, a calendar of events, class schedules, etc. Make this information easy to find in your site layout and navigation.
* Consider the navigation of your site and make it easy to use.
* Consider the text content and images on your site. Text content should be well written and informative, and images should be appropriate and engaging.
* Consider the style of your site and make sure it is polished, professional, and appropriate for the school you have chosen. Your design should be good enough that it could replace the real site!
